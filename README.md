# Getting Started

Instead of some complicated command line nonsense, all you need to do is find the run.bat file in the root folder and either double click it or right click and select run

# Using the Application

To change between an compounding asset (such as a bond) or appeciating asset (such as a stock), click on the dropdown menu at the top left (it should say "Compounding Security" by default) and select your prefered mode <br />
To get current expected APY rates, simply check the 'Use Current Rates' checkbox <br />
To update graph and get final expected value, press the 'Calculate' button at the bottom of the left-hand menu <br />
